If you have received a 1/2-inch, 2400' reel of tape, it was written on a 
SUN2 (or a VAX running Ultrix or BSD 4.2/3).  1/4-inch cartridges were 
written on a SUN2 (QIC-11 or QIC-24 as noted on the label).  

For instructions on installing TeX, see "Installing TeX3.14 on a UNIX 
System," page 1, below.  Information on running UNIX TeX may be found in 
the man page, ./TeX3.14/Man-pages/tex.1, on the tape.  

Documentation for the TeX language may be found in "The TeXbook," by 
Donald Knuth, published by Addison Wesley (ISBN 0-201-13448-9).  The 
older manual, "TeX and Metafont, New Directions in Typesetting," 
published by Digital Press and the AMS, is obsolete.  You may also wish 
to consider getting "LaTeX," by Leslie Lamport, published by Addison 
Wesley (ISBN 0-201-15790-X).  Both of these books were typeset with the  with
system they describe.  

Serious users of the TeX and METAFONT system should invest in the 5-volume 
set "Computers and Typesetting," published by Addison Wesley; and all 
users should invest in a membership in the TeX Users Group (P.O. Box 
594, Providence, R.I. 02901) to keep up to date on new developments.  
For members with access to electronic mail, another service of the TeX 
Users Group is the TeXhax E-mail Digest. 

Your attention is directed to the file ./TeX3.14/COPYING.POLICY which is 
a statement of our policy on redistributing UNIX TeX.  Please also see 
./TeX3.14/README.SCORE which contains additional information about the 
Generic TeX distribution and conditions which apply to this distribution, 
as well. 

The distribution is continually being changed to include new varieties 
of the general Unix system, and such changes inevitably result in errors 
and minor confusion.  We ask for your tolerance.  Please feel free to 
inform us if there are difficulties.

I'm sure I'm going to leave someone off of this list.  If I do, 
don't hesitate to complain. 

WEB-to-C was begun and developed by Tom Rokicki, and brought into 
its present form by Tim Morgan.  It has superseded the Pascal-related 
work described below, but the acknowledgements are still in order. 

In the major overhaul for TeX 3.0, and for heading the team of 
WEB-to-C wizards, special thanks go to Karl Berry.  

John Ramsdell has given some long-awaited attention to the problem of
compilation in a networked system.  

The initial TeX Unix ports were independently developed by Howard Trickey 
of Stanford and Pavel Curtis of Cornell.  Howard was responsible for 
most of the bugfixes, enhancements, and updates over the first few years. 

The SUN TeX port was independently carried out by people at three 
locations: Mike Harrison and Charles Perkins at U.C. Berkeley, Rusty 
Wright at U.C. San Diego, and Steve Correll of Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratories.  The versions of the files contained here merge their 
work. 

The Pascal System V port for the 3B2 was contributed by Lou Salkind 
of NYU. 

As for METAFONT, the vast majority of the work on Pascal compilation 
was done by Paul Richards of the University of Illinois, and most of 
the associated MFlib library is his. 

Many other individuals have been involved with the device drivers 
and other software.  We've tried to mention these people in "ORIGIN" 
files in the various subdirectories.  Again, apologies to anyone we 
missed.  

There are also many people over the years who have helped improve 
the quality of the distribution with bug alerts, fixes, comments, 
suggestions for improvements, and information about the installation 
of TeX and METAFONT on new machines.  Since it is impossible to name 
each of you, we wish to acknowledge and to thank you here as a group.

Installing TeX3.14 on a Unix System 
================================== 


We strongly advise that you install TeX3.14 and METAFONT2.7.  If, 
however, you encounter a great many problems during installation, 
and are not able to spare the time to solve them on your system, 
please get in touch with us to arrange exchanging your tape for 
a copy of TeX2.991 and METAFONT1.8, which are known to run on a 
good many machines (see the file called MACHINES.tex82). 

Do not ignore the making and installing of METAFONT programs.  
Owing to the sheer size of a generalized font library, we cannot
provide you with all the fonts you may need to process and 
print the .dvi files at your site.  What is on the tape is enough 
to handle the essentials of TeX, LaTeX, and SliTeX.  Chances are
good that you will, at some time or another, need more .tfm and 
rastered fonts than are provided on the tape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


The following instructions assume you will be using WEB-to-C to 
convert Donald Knuth's WEB code into C for the compilation of TeX 
and METAFONT.  

  WEB is the macro language in which the whole of the TeX package, 
  including METAFONT, is written.  For details about this language, 
  see the manual "The WEB System of Structured Documentation" 
  (./TeX3.14/TeXdoc/webman.tex).  

  During the making of TeX and METAFONT, the macro processor tangle 
  converts WEB files into Pascal-language files.  WEB-to-C takes 
  this Pascal output, and converts it into C.  
  
Please note that if you wish to have the minimum of trouble with 
compilation and installation, you should keep the present hierarchy 
of directories under ./TeX3.14 intact, for the makefiles depend on it. 


1.  START by reading the tape onto your system. 


2.  Change to the ./TeX3.14 directory.
                               
    We recommend that you read through README.W2C to get an overview 
    of the conversion process.  Be aware that the top-level makefile
    takes care of many of the steps delineated in this file, and that 
    --in this distribution--Big TeX/METAFONT/BibTeX are made by default. 

    Also: please be sure to read the files MACHINES.W2C and PROBLEMS.W2C,
    and take notes concerning matters that pertain to your machine, 
    operating system, and compiler. 


3.  Edit site.h (the master configuration file for WEB-to-C) to suit 
    your system and site.  

    The file includes the following default TeX and METAFONT search-path 
    definitions: 
  
        #define TEXFONTS          ".:/usr/local/lib/tex/fonts"
        #define TEXFORMATS        ".:/usr/local/lib/tex/formats"
        #define TEXINPUTS         ".:/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs"
        #define TEXPOOL           "/usr/local/lib/tex"
        #define MFBASES           ".:/usr/local/lib/mf/bases"
        #define MFINPUTS          ".:/usr/local/lib/mf/inputs"
        #define MFPOOL            "/usr/local/lib/mf"

    These paths are used by TeX and METAFONT to find input files, .fmt 
    or .base files, and information about fonts and string pools. 

    If you will be making and using virtual fonts, un-comment the line 
    that defines VFFONTS, and give the path to the directory in which 
    you will be storing these fonts.  

    BibTeX users should also define BIBINPUTS.

    Please note that these paths are advisory, not absolute.  We 
    cannot dictate the organization of your /usr partition.  (If you 
    substitute the C-shell "setenv" command for "#define" you can 
    ensure that your environment matches your decisions here, and you 
    can "set" and "export" these equivalences in the Bourne shell.  
    The man page for TeX--./TeX3.14/Man-pages/tex.1--discusses this 
    more fully.)  Whatever changes you make in the paths, it is 
    advisable to retain the dot preceding the colon for most of the 
    search-path definitions so that TeX and METAFONT will always search 
    your current directory first.  

    Note that the default compilation produces a Big TeX with large 
    hyphenation trie, Big METAFONT, and Big BibTeX.  This size is very 
    useful when you are using two or three very large macro packages 
    at the same time, and also for very large documents with complex 
    pages and inserts.

    	If, for some strange reason, your system cannot run 
       	Big TeX, be sure to attend to your definition of the
        type 'glueratio' in site.h.  Then, before compiling, 
        go to the directory ./tex, and move ctex.ch to ctex32.ch;
        then, copy ctex16.ch to ctex.ch.  This will result in
        a compilation of a small tex.  Do the same in the
        directory ./mf: move cmf.ch to cmf32.ch, and copy cmf16.ch 
        to cmf.ch before you begin to compile; this will produce
        a small metafont.  (You will always be able to restore
        a Big TeX by patching your small ctex.ch file with bigtex.diff,
        a Big MF by patching your small cmf.ch with bigmf.diff; or,
        more simply, by reversing your steps and copying your
        ctex.ch to ctex16.ch, and moving ctex32.ch to ctex.ch.)

    Proceed through the rest of site.h, using or changing the default 
    settings to suit your system and site.


4.  Check the master makefile to be sure that all definitions and 
    paths given in this file suit your site. 
  
    Make certain to define your C compiler correctly.  

	If you are not using gcc, and if you prefer, you could 
	define your C compiler at the same time that you give 
	your "make" command, by typing

		% make CC="cc" 

    	(The "%" is presumed to be your C-shell prompt.  It will 
	probably be "$" if you are in the Bourne shell.  The example 
	just given assumes that you wish to invoke cc.)

    Attend to the definitions for OPT=, SHELL=, YACC=, etc., etc.  
    Note that "bison" is GNU's "domesticated yacc"; if you are using cc,
    simply define this as "yacc," or whatever is appropriate at your site.

    Be sure to give the necessary values to wlibs= for METAFONT 
    window support.  For example, if you are running SunView, modify 
    the line to read wlibs=${sunlib}. 

    If you know that you will not be using LaTeX or SliTeX, remove 
    them from the formats= line.  (If you plan to install the TeXPS 
    PostScript driver, however, keep in mind that LaTeX will be needed
    to print out its manual.  AMSLaTeX and AMSTeX users: dump the 
    formats for these programs later; see the subdirectories under 
    ./ams, which is parallel to the current directory TeX3.14.)

    Attend to the definition for localmodes= :

	If you are updating TeX on your machine, you will already
	have a file containing mode_defs for various output devices
	at your site.  Look for it in your MFINPUTS directory;
	the name of your site will probably be a part of its name 
	(e.g., <SITE>-modes.mf or <SITE>.mf).  The name of this 
	file (minus the extension) belongs on this line; that is,
	assuming you see no reason for changing.

	If you are installing TeX for the first time on your machine,
	you will be copying the file ../utilityfonts/bases/modes.mf 
	into your MFINPUTS directory in Step 5.f below.  Since the 
	default is modes.mf, no editing is required.

    Proceed through the makefile, attending to the definition of 
    programs and paths as they exist on your system.  

    Note for INSTALL=: the "-g tex" sets the group ownership of the
    files to be installed, as "tex."  Unless such a group exists on
    your system, you will receive "unknown group" complaints during 
    installation.

    The definitions for texpooldir, texinputdir, etc., should match 
    your definitions for TEXPOOL, TEXINPUTS, etc., as you defined 
    them in site.h.  

    On most systems, cmsources= will be identical to mfinputdir= .
    Define this according to the arrangement on your machine.

    Note that the default is to make all.  We recommend that you 
    do so; but if, for example, you know that no one at your site 
    will be using BibTeX because they are all users of tib, you 
    can remove bibtex from the alldirs= line, and it will not be
    made.  

    Line 95 of the makefile says that "Stuff below here probably 
    doesn't need to be changed."  That is true; but please note 
    for the target install (at line 187), that the texware programs 
    patgen and pooltype--while made by default--are not installed 
    by default.  If you wish to have them placed in your bindir 
    during installation via this makefile, add a couple of lines 
    for them.


5.  Prepare the areas for compilation:

        a.  Make a directory named /usr/local/lib/tex (or whatever 
            you have defined in site.h as your TEXPOOL environment).

	b.  Make a subdirectory named /usr/local/lib/tex/formats
	    (or whatever you have chosen for the environment TEXFORMATS).
  
        c.  Make a subdirectory named /usr/local/lib/tex/fonts (or 
            whatever you have chosen for the environment TEXFONTS).  

              Copy the contents of ./TeXfonts to it.

                 You now have in your TEXFONTS directory, the *.tfm 
                 fonts called for by plain.tex and lplain.tex.  
		 They are enough only to handle the essentials of 
		 TeX, LaTeX, and SliTeX.  To generate other fonts from 
		 the metafont sources provided on the tape (see, for
		 example, the files in ./cmfonts/mf), you will have 
		 to use METAFONT.

                     NOTE: If you are an AMSTeX user, additional *.tfm files 
		     are in ./ams/amsfonts/tfm.  You may find it convenient 
		     to copy them into your TEXFONTS environment at this 
 		     time, if you wish.

                     We encourage users of AMSTeX to get in touch directly 
		     with the American Mathematical Society to keep up to date 
		     with respect to versions of its macros and fonts.
                     The AMS material on the tape is present entirely because 
		     of their generosity, but we do not actively seek to keep
                     the material up to date.  The focus of this distribution 
                     is on keeping the primary TeX and METAFONT material 
                     updated and ported to UNIX, beginning with the machines 
                     we have available to us.

		     The AMS macros and fonts on the current tape are from
		     July-September 1990.  If it is important that what you 
		     print out be visually identical to material printed out 
		     under the older AMSTeX, we recommend that you keep both 
       		     old and current AMS fonts on your system.  If you can 
		     imagine the possibility at some time, of having to 
		     regenerate a document that must be visually the same 
		     as one generated under the old AMSTeX, archive the
		     older fonts on your system so that they will be
		     available to you when such a need arises.  The older 
		     fonts and the current fonts are not identical.

        d.  Make another subdirectory named 
            /usr/local/lib/tex/inputs (or whatever you have chosen 
            for the environment TEXINPUTS).  

            If you are planning to use BibTeX, also make a 
            subdirectory /usr/local/lib/tex/bib (or whatever you 
            defined in site.h for your environment BIBINPUTS). 

	e.  Make the following METAFONT directories and subdirectories:

	      /usr/local/lib/mf
	      /usr/local/lib/mf/bases
              /usr/local/lib/mf/inputs

	    (or whatever you have defined as your MFPOOL, MFBASES, and
   	    MFINPUTS environments in site.h).  See README.METAFONT, 
   	    "METAFONT Installation Guide," Step 3, for a bit more detail.

        f.  Take a look at the script Install_INPUTS.
             	
              Make sure that the paths to TEXINPUTS and MFINPUTS are 
              defined correctly.  And, if it applies, make certain that 
              the path to BIBINPUTS is similarly defined correctly.
              Edit this script file if you wish.  For your information: 
                 
              The files from ./TeXmacros are necessary for users 
              of plain.tex. The files from ./LaTeX and 
              ./LaTeX/LaTeXmacros are necessary for LaTeX users, 
              as well as for those who wish eventually to print 
              out a copy of the manual for the TeXPS PostScript 
              driver.  The files from ./LaTeX/LaTeXmakeindex are 
              necessary for those who wish to run that program.  
              The ./LaTeX/LaTeXslitex files are necessary for 
              users of SliTeX.  The files from ./BibTeX.inputs 
              are necessary for users of BiBTeX.  Some of the 
	      *.mf files copied into MFINPUTS are needed by inimf 
              to create base files.  The base files will be used 
	      by virmf--the production version of METAFONT--
              for generating rastered fonts at magnifications 
              not provided on the distribution tape.  (For details 
	      about MFINPUTS and about other uses for METAFONT,
              first see Steps 3 and 4 of the "METAFONT Installation
              Guide" in README.METAFONT, then be sure to read 
              ./Man-pages/mf.1.)

            If everything suits you, run the script by typing its 
            name at the prompt. 

	      AMSTeX/AMSLaTeX users: see the various READ.ME files
	      in ./ams (parallel to ./TeX3.14).  You may wish to 
	      complete the primary TeX installation first; or, 
	      if you wish, copy the AMSTeX/AMSLaTeX macros into your 
              TEXINPUTS directory at this time.  It is probably simpler
	      to do the installation of AMSTeX/AMSLaTeX separately, 
	      after the primary TeX installation is done.

	g.  If you are installing TeX and METAFONT for the first time
	    on your system, go now to your MFINPUTS directory.  

	    Inspect modes.mf to see that it includes a definition for
	    a mode (i.e., a mode_def) for an output device corresponding 
	    to the device for which you will be generating fonts.

         	For example: if you have an Apple LaserWriter,
         	you will need a mode_def for its Canon CX engine.

    	    Check to see that "localfont := " (near the end of the file) 
	    names the mode for your device.  The default is "CanonCX"
	    (a 300dpi write-black print engine used in several laser-
	    printers).  If necessary, edit this line to name the mode_def
	    appropriate for your output device.

            Remember that write-white devices take special care. 
	    The Ricoh 4080 print engine is one such device; 
	    try the RicohFourZeroEightZero mode_def; 
	    and see the file README.WRITE-W for more information.
	    
         	If you have another device at another resolution, you can 
         	usually get a good idea where to start by looking at the 
         	various device-support sections of this file.  The blacker 
         	and fillin values are the most difficult to set, and you may 
         	wish to make several tries at different settings on a range 
         	of magsteps before you decide on the values.  (To learn 
         	more about mode_defs, see The METAFONTbook.) 

         	If nothing in this file suits your site, know that several 
         	well-tested |mode_def|s can be found in issues of TUGboat, 
         	the journal of the TeX Users Group. 


6.  Double-check to see that you are still in TeX3.14, and type 

        % make

    This will build tangle, initex, virtex, tex.pool, and the 
    utilities in ./texware, as well as inimf, virmf, mf.pool and the 
    utilities in ./mfware, ./dviutil, and ./fontutil.  It will also 
    build bibtex. 

    If your make halts early on in the compilation due to the "until"
    construction in the ./web/Makefile, copy (do not use mv) the file
    tangleboot.pas to tangle.p, and start your make again.

    If your make halts otherwise, check the MACHINES.W2C and PROBLEMS.W2C 
    files for notes concerning your machine.  Also check the make.history 
    file to see whether the terminal listing of a successful make on our
    SUN2/120, with our comments added where the make was halted, might
    help you on your system.

    After compilation, the executable TeX files initex and virtex, and 
    the file tex.pool, will be found in the directory ./tex. 

    The METAFONT analogs inimf, virmf, and mf.pool will be in ./mf. 


7.  If you now type

        % make install

    at your prompt, these files will be copied for you into your 
    BINDIR, TEXPOOL, and MFPOOL environments.
 
    Type rehash, or do whatever you must do, to make accessible to you 
    these newly installed programs. 


8.  Next, create the format files by typing

	% make formats

    at your prompt.  If you did not edit the formats= line in the makefile, 
    tex.fmt (i.e., plain.fmt), latex.fmt (lplain3.fmt), and slitex.fmt 
    (splain3.fmt) will be made by default.

    Install these by typing the following at your prompt:

	% make install-formats
 
    The files will be placed in your TEXFORMATS directory; plain.fmt 
    will be linked to the name tex.fmt.  And, in your BINDIR, virtex 
    will be linked to the base names of the formats you have installed.
    
        For a general understanding of how the current TeX loads a 
	format file, we recommend that you read the TeX man-page 
	(./TeX3.14/Man-pages/tex.1).   Since TeX now looks at its own 
	command line to determine what name it is being called under, 
	if you invoke it as tex, it will "look" at  own name, attach 
	the .fmt suffix to it, and will load a format file having 
	that name.  Since the plain.fmt file has been linked to tex.fmt, 
	TeX invoked as tex is ready to go.  

            It may be useful to know that the name tex is 
            conventionally applied to a virtex with the plain.fmt 
            loaded.  In other words, invoking TeX by typing tex is 
            the same thing as invoking TeX by typing virtex '\&plain'. 
	    Be sure to read ./TeX3.14/Man-pages/tex.1 so that you 
	    understand how this works, and so that you will know what 
	    other options are open to you. 

9.  Next, make the METAFONT base files (mf.base and cmmf.base are made
    by default) and install them by typing the following at your prompt:

	% make bases

	% make install-bases

    The files will be placed in your MFBASES directory; plain.base will
    be linked to mf.base.  And, in your BINDIR, virmf will be linked to
    the names of the bases you have installed. 

    	For a general understanding of how these base files are used, 
	see the METAFONT man-page (./TeX3.14/Man-pages/mf.1).

    Type rehash or whatever is necessary to make the programs available 
    to you.  You are now ready to run METAFONT--either as cmmf (to 
    generate Computer Modern fonts), or as mf (to generate any number 
    of other fonts; for example, the line and circle fonts for LaTeX).


Your installation of TeX and METAFONT is complete.  Enjoy them!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Notes:


Man-pages: there are currently two sets of man-pages on the distribution.  
Those in ./man are streamlined and more recent versions.  They will be
installed for you if you type make manpages and make install-manpages 
at your prompt.  Before installing them, however, we recommend that 
you look at the ./man/Makefile to make certain that the default 
settings suit you (for example, note that the man-pages for patgen and
pooltype do not get installed unless you remove the hash mark (#) in
front of each filename).  Please note that some of the older man-pages 
(in ./Man-pages) contain a fuller explanation of the programs--in 
particular, note the ./Man-pages/mf.1 and tex.1 man-pages.

When would you use METAFONT to generate a font?

        Say that you have a document in which the cmbx12 typeface 
        at magstep 2 is required.  TeX will scale this font 
        to that magnification, using the cmbx12.tfm font file copied 
        by you into your TEXFONTS environment in Step 5.b above.
        In order to print the document on a 300dpi printer, however, 
        you will need the rastered font cmbx12.432pk.  While the 
        rastered font cmbx12.300pk (the cmbx12 typeface at magstep 
        0) is on the tape, the rastered font cmbx12.432pk (the same 
        typeface at magstep 2) is not.  You will then have to 
        generate that rastered font via METAFONT.  


                         * * * * *

For an overview of the different kinds of fonts associated with TeX,

Numerous printer drivers and previewers are to be found in a 
directory parallel to ./TeX3.14 called ./DVIware.  We regret very 
much to say that, not having the equipment, we are not able to 
support the programs in the ./DVIware  directory.  The previewer and 
printer driver programs are passed on to you because they are 
frequently requested, and because people have been generous in 
offering them for distribution.

Installing TeX3.14 on a Unix System:  Making a .fmt file:
======================================================== 

You should be aware that there are three kinds of TeXs in use.  
These are represented by initex, virtex, and tex.  Initex is used to 
install TeX, starting from scratch.  Initex loads font data, 
hyphenation data, and macro packages, and then dumps its entire 
internal state into a .fmt file when given the \dump command.  
Virtex is able to read the information in this .fmt file back in, 
making its internal state the same as initex's when the \dump 
occurred.  Like initex, virtex can also load font data and macro 
packages.  However, virtex cannot read in the hyphenation patterns.  
The name tex is conventionally applied to a virtex with the .fmt 
named plain.fmt loaded. 

If you need to make a new .fmt file (say a new plain.fmt) do the 
following: 

        % initex plain '\dump'
        This is TeX, C Version n.nnn (INITEX)
        ...

Initex will process the file plain.tex and then create the plain.fmt 
file (printing informative messages on your terminal as the process 
is carried out).  For LaTeX and SliTeX, you dump lplain to 
lplain.fmt and splain to splain.fmt. 

Incidentally, if you get the virtex error, "Fatal Format Error, I'm 
Stymied," particularly after you've changed things around, try 
remaking the .fmt file as a first attempt to solving the problem. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------


Please be aware that creating a macro package to be turned into a 
preloaded TeX is a task for experts and may not work for all 
possible macros.  For example, an \everyjob token stream if present 
in a macro package being preloaded will be executed before the \read 
happens.  Consequently, if you want to preload macro packages which 
you have created, you should take care that \everyjob's don't do 
anything to cause the log file to be opened.  For example, referring 
the \jobname does this, so don't do \everyjob{\message{\jobname}} in 
your macro package (this would always produce the uninteresting 
message, "texput," anyway).  In case you are now worried, rest 
assured that the plain and latex macro packages do not have problems 
like the one just described.

Font Notes (1):  What do tfm, pk, gf, pxl, pl, mf, vf, and vp mean? 
=================================================================== 

Font files come in several varieties, with suffixes like:

.tfm     .?pk     .?gf     .?pxl (obsolete)     .pl     .mf     .vf     .vp 

A .tfm (TeX Font Metric) file is a compact binary file that contains 
information about each character in a font, about combinations of 
characters within that font, and about the font as a whole.  The 
font metric data contained in .tfm files and given in device-
independent units, are used by TeX to format the page and produce 
.dvi (device-independent) files.  Since TeX does scaling 
calculations, one .tfm file serves for all magnifications of a given 
typeface.  (This is to say that all TeX needs in order to typeset a 
document that calls, at various points, for the typeface known as 
Computer Modern Bold Extended at 12 points (cmbx12) at magsteps 0, 
1, and 2, is the cmbx12.tfm file.) 

In order to print these .dvi files on real devices, you need 
rastered font files containing digitized character shapes and other 
data needed by previewers and printer-driver programs that will take 
your .dvi files and convert them into something usable by your 
terminal or printer.  Rastered fonts come with suffixes like .?pk, 
.?gf, and .?pxl.  The "?" stands for the horizontal dots-per-inch 
resolution of the font (unless the font has been magnified).  The 
letters "pk," "gf," and "pxl" stand for different font formats.  

Fonts in pk format are in the tightly packed format that is pretty 
much the standard for printers and printer-drivers today.  They take 
up less space than fonts in gf (generic font) format--the format in 
which METAFONT generates fonts, and far less space than fonts in pxl 
format.  Fonts in pxl format take up gross amounts of disk space and 
permit only 128 characters.  They are considered obsolete, and we 
discourage their use. 

Font files with the .pl (Property List) suffix, are the ASCII 
(human-readable) analog of binary .tfm files. 

Font files with the .mf suffix are in METAFONT source format.  These 
are the files used by METAFONT to generate rastered fonts for 
specific typefaces at specific magnifications for the specific 
resolution and type of mapping used by your print engine.

The .tfm files for Donald Knuth's Computer Modern fonts are provided 
on the tape in the directory ./TeX3.14/TeXfonts, along with the .tfm 
files for utilityfonts, LaTeX, and AMS fonts.

The rastered forms of the Computer Modern and LaTeX fonts necessary 
to run the basic versions of TeX,  LaTeX, and SliTeX, are on the 
tape in pk format--in pk120, pk240, and pk300 dpi series--in the 
directories ./cmfonts/pk and ./LaTeXfonts/pk.  AMS fonts are provided 
through the courtesy of the American Mathematical Society, and are in 
the base directory ./ams.  See ./ams/amsfonts/pk for rastered fonts 
in pk300 dpi series.

        Fonts in the subdirectory pk300 are set for BLACK-ON-WHITE 
        mapping (CanonCX print engine).  If you are using a WHITE-
        ON-BLACK engine, such as the RicohFourZeroEight Zero (4080), 
        be sure to read ./TeX3.14/README.WRITE-WHITE, and to use the 
        fonts in pk300w.  If you are using any other print engine, 
        you should compile fonts to fit it.  The distribution fonts 
        will only be an indicator of what the device can do. 

        The utilities gftopk and pktogf--for converting gf font 
        files into more compact pk font files and vice versa--are 
        provided (in ./TeX3.14/mfware and in ./TeX3.14/fontutil, 
        respectively).  The programs pxtopk and pktopx--for 
        converting obsolete pxl font files into pk format and vice 
        versa--are provided in ./Unsupported/MFpxl/CMFpxlware.  
        Please know that pktopx can only be used on 128 character 
        fonts.  Many of the newer fonts contain 255 characters, and 
        will not work with a pxl device at all.  We advise you to 
        convert your driver to read gf or pk (or both). 

        If your printer uses only gf fonts, be sure to read the 
        README file in ./cmfonts/gf and LaTeXfonts/gf for the use of 
        makefiles in these directories to generate the fonts you need. 
	For AMS fonts, please see the makefiles in ./ams/amsfonts/gf
	and ./ams/amsfonts/gf/gf300.	

        To convert binary .tfm files into human-readable .pl 
        (property-list) files, use the texware routine tftopl. 

The extension .vf identifies a file written in virtual font file format. 
The fontutil routine vftovp converts .vf font files into human-readable 
.vp (virtual font property-list) files.  For Donald Knuth's discussion of 
these new fonts, see the ./TeX3.14/fontutil/README.virtual_fonts file. 

We supply the full Computer Modern, LaTeX, and SliTeX fonts in mf 
source format, in the directories ./cmfonts/mf and ./LaTeXfonts/mf.  
The METAFONT source files for the AMS fonts are distributed for 
non-profit scholarly use by the American Mathematical Society; 
see subdirectories of ./ams/amsfonts.

Font Notes (2):  More About Rastered Fonts  
========================================== 


As noted above, the *.tfm files are all that TeX needs to make a 
.dvi file; and you only need one to cover all magnifications for any 
specific typeface.  This is not true for rastered fonts that will 
actually print on real devices.  For these, you need a distinct file 
for each resolution, for each print engine, and for each 
magnification.  This is to say that, in order to typeset a document 
calling for the typeface cmbx12 at magsteps 0, 1, and 2, you need 
only have the cmbx12.tfm file on your system.  In order to print 
that document, however, you will need three different rastered font 
files--cmbx12.300pk, cmbx12.360pk, and cmbx12.432pk.  

But while you have to load all of the .tfm files that plain.tex, 
lfonts.tex, or sfonts.tex ask for, you only have to load fonts at 
the actual .????[gf, pk] magnifications that you really expect to 
use, at the actual resolution in dots-per-inch of your printer, and 
for the type of mapping used by the particular type of print engine 
you have.  This means that if you never print a document calling for 
cmbx12 at magstep 3, you need never place the rastered font 
cmbx12.518pk onto your system; and that if your printer is a 300dpi 
printer and your previewer uses 300dpi fonts, you need never copy 
any of the font files from the subdirectories pk118 and pk200 from 
the tape onto your system; and that if your device uses BLACK-ON-
WHITE mapping, you need never use the fonts in the subdirectory 
pk300w on the tape. 

Let us say that you have a 300dpi printer with an engine set for 
BLACK-ON-WHITE mapping that uses fonts in pk format, and that you 
will be using the Computer Modern fonts.  The first thing you will 
have to do (after you have chosen a printer driver program) is to 
copy the contents of ./cmfonts/pk/pk300 from the distribution tape 
onto your system.  Where exactly on your system is determined by the 
driver you choose. 

   Because there is as yet no standard organization for rastered 
   fonts, we cannot give you generalized advice about where to place 
   such fonts.  You should probably not copy them into your TEXFONTS 
   environment.  (The file ./TeX3.14/site.h which you edited for your 
   making of TeX and METAFONT, and in which you defined the various 
   environments for TeX and METAFONT on your system, has no effect 
   on any of the dvi interpreters in this package.)  The TEXFONTS 
   environment should probably be reserved for .tfm files.  The 
   rastered fonts necessary for previewing and printing should 
   probably be kept in an entirely separate place; and it is 
   probably best to distinguish one rastered font format from 
   another, if you plan to use more than one type. 

If you examine the contents of the ./cmfonts/pk/pk300 directory, you 
will see that cmbx12.300pk is the only cmbx12 font in it.  That is 
the font cmbx12 at magstep 0 for your 300dpi printer.  The 
distribution does not provide cmbx12 at magsteps 1 and 2 for 300dpi 
printers.  This is because, owing to the sheer size of a generalized 
font library, we cannot possibly provide you with all the fonts you 
may need at your installation.  What we provide is enough to handle 
the essentials of TeX, LaTeX, and SliTeX---no more.  And that is why 
we give you METAFONT in the standard web2c compilation.  

The documents pertinent to the installation of METAFONT and to the 
generation of fonts are ./TeX3.14/README.METAFONT and ./TeX3.14/Man-
pages/mf.1.  

When you have METAFONT installed, it should only be a short while 
before you are generating the rastered fonts cmbx12.360pk (cmbx12 at 
magstep 1), cmbx12.432pk (cmbx12 at magstep 2), and any other 
typeface for which there are METAFONT source files, at 
magnifications needed by the devices at your site.
